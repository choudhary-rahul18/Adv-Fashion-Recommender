# 👗 Advanced Multimodal Fashion Recommender
This project is a cutting-edge fashion search engine that leverages Multimodal Embeddings, Generative AI (LLMs), and Vector Databases to provide highly accurate, budget-aware product recommendations. By integrating visual features with semantic intent and price constraints, the system handles complex natural language queries like "Elegant teal Anarkali for a wedding under 4000" with sub-second precision.

## 🚀 System Architecture & Procedure
The recommendation engine follows a sophisticated four-stage pipeline to bridge the gap between human language and visual fashion attributes.

### 1. Data Engineering & Semantic Fusion

The foundation of the system is built on a dataset of over 14,000 fashion products.

Semantic Concatenation: To maximize search accuracy, unstructured attributes (brand, color, material, and style) were fused into a single unified semantic string (final_text).

Price Normalization: Since price is a critical search dimension, I implemented a Log-Transformation followed by Min-Max Scaling to ensure budget constraints are mathematically aligned with semantic vectors.

### 2. The 1025-Dimensional "Master Vector"

The core innovation is a custom Master Vector architecture that allows for simultaneous visual, textual, and economic search.

Vector Composition: [Visual Part (512)] + [Text Part (512)] + [Normalized Price (1)].

Weighted Retrieval: During the search, visual signals are weighted (1.5x) to prioritize style and aesthetics, while the text and price components ensure the results match the specific brand and budget intent.

### 3. Real-time Search Intent (LLM Reasoning)

To handle the "gap" between a user's short query and a machine's vector requirements, the system uses Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Visual Expansion: Gemini expands a simple query into a rich, CLIP-optimized description (e.g., "red dress" becomes "A vibrant crimson maxi dress in flowy chiffon, suitable for formal evening events").

Few-Shot Prompting: The system uses in-context learning to extract precise price filters and design attributes in structured JSON format.

### 4. Vector Storage & HNSW Retrieval

ChromaDB: All 14,000+ master vectors are stored in a persistent ChromaDB collection.

Semantic Search: The system uses Cosine Similarity to retrieve the top 6 matches in milliseconds, even on local hardware like a MacBook Air.

💡 Key Challenges Solved
Context Window Limits: Managed CLIP’s 77-token limit by implementing truncation and prompt constraints within the LLM expansion logic.

Attribute Sparsity: Solved the issue of missing descriptions by engineering a "Semantic Proxy" string from available product attributes.

Scale: Optimized the ingestion process into batches of 1000 to handle over 14,000 items efficiently.
